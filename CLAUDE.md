# HFSE SIS — Claude Instructions

A Student Information System for HFSE International School, Singapore. Modules — Markbook, Attendance, P-Files, Records, SIS Admin — are surfaces of one student record, not sibling apps. The module switcher moves between them; `studentNumber` is the backbone.

## Stable rules — auto-loaded (every session)

These two are `@`-imported so they're always in context. Do not edit without explicit user approval.

@.claude/rules/always-do-first.md
@.claude/rules/hard-rules.md

## Stable rules — on-demand (read with the Read tool when relevant)

Not `@`-imported. Each file carries YAML frontmatter (`description`, `load: on-demand`) explaining its trigger. Read before acting when any of the "Read when..." conditions apply.

| Rule | Read when... |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/rules/tech-stack.md` | Touching code, installing/upgrading a dep, debugging a framework behavior, or a Next.js 16 gotcha |
| `.claude/rules/project-layout.md` | Creating new files, moving code between modules, or deciding where a new route or lib lives |
| `.claude/rules/env-vars.md` | Touching `.env.local`, Supabase/auth plumbing, or Resend emails |
| `.claude/rules/key-decisions.md` | A "KD #N" reference appears in code or docs; cross-cutting architectural choices; doubt about module boundaries, roles, or conventions |
| `.claude/rules/design-system.md` | Before any UI / frontend code; when choosing a shadcn primitive, token, color, or layout |
| `.claude/rules/workflow.md` | Finishing work — before reporting a task done, or at session wrap-up |

## Session context

<!--
Scratch surface for session-learned context, temporary caveats, in-flight
investigations. Safe to edit; pruned periodically. Stable rules do NOT go
here — they live in `.claude/rules/*.md`.

## Cross-reference note

Cross-references elsewhere in the repo such as "CLAUDE.md Hard Rule #N" or "CLAUDE.md KD #N" now resolve to `.claude/rules/hard-rules.md` and `.claude/rules/key-decisions.md` respectively. Numbering is preserved; only the host file moved.
